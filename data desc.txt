"_id": This field appears to be a unique identifier for each event record. It could be useful for tracking or referencing specific events.
"alert_category": This field seems to contain a classification or categorization of the event, such as "Not Suspicious Traffic" or "Access Denied". This information could be used to filter or group events by their category.
"alert_cve_id": This field appears to contain a reference to a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier, which is a standardized identifier for publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. This information could be used to assess the potential risk posed by an event.
"alert_signature": This field seems to contain a description or summary of the event, such as "ET INFO Potentially unsafe SMBv1 protocol in use". This information could be useful for understanding the nature of an event and determining an appropriate response.
"alert_signature_id": This field appears to contain a unique identifier for the event's "alert_signature". This could be useful for tracking or referencing specific signatures.
"app_proto": This field seems to contain the name of the application protocol associated with the event, such as "smb" or "ssh". This information could be used to understand the context of an event or to filter events by protocol.
"dest_ip": This field contains the IP address of the destination for the event. This could be useful for understanding the intended target of an event or for tracking network traffic to specific IPs.
"dest_port": This field contains the port number associated with the destination IP address. This could be useful for understanding the specific service or application being accessed at the destination.
"dns_rrname": This field seems to contain the name of a Domain Name System (DNS) resource record. DNS is a system that translates domain names to IP addresses, and a resource record is a type of data stored in the DNS system. This information could be useful for understanding the context of an event involving DNS.
"event_type": This field contains a classification of the event, such as "smb" or "alert". This information could be useful for understanding the general type of event or for filtering events by type.
"geoip_*": These fields contain geographical information about the source or destination of the event, such as the country, city, and latitude/longitude coordinates. This information could be useful for understanding the geographical context of an event or for tracking the location of network traffic.
"icmp_code" and "icmp_type": These fields contain the code and type of an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) message, respectively. ICMP is a protocol used for communication between network devices, and these fields could be useful for understanding the nature of an event involving ICMP.
"ip_rep": This field appears to contain a reputation score for the source IP address. A reputation score is a measure of the perceived trustworthiness of an IP address, based on its past behavior. This information could be useful for identifying potentially malicious traffic.
"kibana_id": This field appears to contain a unique identifier for the event within the Kibana system. Kibana is a tool for visualizing and analyzing data, and this identifier could be used to reference specific events within Kibana.
"payload_printable": This field seems to contain a printable representation of the payload or data associated with the event. The payload is the data being transmitted as part of the event, and the printable representation is a version of the payload that can be displayed as text rather than binary data. This information could be useful for understanding the content or purpose of an event.
"proto": This field contains the name of the transport protocol used for the event, such as "TCP" or "UDP". This information could be useful for understanding the general type of event or for filtering events by protocol.
"rfb_authentication_vnc_challenge" and "rfb_authentication_vnc_response": These fields seem to contain information related to the authentication process for a Remote Framebuffer (RFB) protocol connection using Virtual Network Computing (VNC). RFB is a protocol for remote access to graphical user interfaces, and VNC is a software suite that implements RFB. These fields could be useful for understanding the context of an event involving RFB/VNC.
"sip_method" and "sip_request_line": These fields contain the method and request line of a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) message, respectively. SIP is a protocol used for initiating, modifying, and terminating interactive user sessions involving video, voice, messaging, and other communications applications and services. These fields could be useful for understanding the context of an event involving SIP.
"src_ip": This field contains the IP address of the source for the event. This could be useful for understanding the origin of an event or for tracking network traffic from specific IPs.
"src_port": This field contains the port number associated with the source IP address. This could be useful for understanding the specific service or application being accessed at the source.
"ssh_client_hassh_hash", "ssh_client_software_version", "ssh_server_hassh_hash": These fields seem to contain information related to the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, which is a secure network protocol used for remote command-line access and remote command execution. The "ssh_client_hassh_hash" and "ssh_server_hassh_hash" fields appear to contain hashes of the client and server SSH implementations, respectively, and the "ssh_client_software_version" field contains the version of the client software. These fields could be useful for understanding the context of an event involving SSH.
"tags": This field appears to contain an array of labels or tags associated with the event. These tags could be used to add additional context or metadata to the event.
"timestamp": This field contains a timestamp indicating when the event occurred. This information could be useful for understanding the chronological context of an event or for tracking the occurrence of events over time.
"type": This field contains the name of the tool or system that generated the event record, in this case "Suricata". This information could be useful for understanding the source of the event data.
