Your organization is using a network security monitoring tool to collect data on network events, and you have been provided with a dataset of event records in the same format as the JSON objects above. Your task is to build a classifier that can predict the "event_type" of new, unseen events based on the available features in the data.

To solve this problem, you would need to:

1. Explore the dataset to understand the distribution and characteristics of the different event types.
2. Preprocess the data as needed, such as by handling missing values or encoding categorical features.
3. Split the dataset into training and test sets.
4. Train a classifier on the training set using an appropriate machine learning algorithm.
5. Evaluate the class
